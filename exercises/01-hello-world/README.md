# `01` Hello World

HTML is a markup language, meaning that everything you type must be wraped in opening and closing `<tags>`, like this:

```html
<span>Hello, I am a text</span>
<strong>Hello, I am also a text but in bold</strong>
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please `remove` the current website content, `add` the above tags to your website.

## 💻 Expected Result:

Your final website should be something like this:
