# What is HTML5?
HTML5 is the latest standard of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes the structure and presentation of web pages.
It's made up of three codes: HTML, which keeps the structure; CSS, which affects the presentation; and JavaScript, which creates interactive effects within web browsers.

Simplified: HTML is a set of rules that tell web browsers how to interpret code to display web pages. HTML5, the 5th version of this set, improves and upgrades website capabilities, and helps developers make web content, such as websites and web applications, more interactive and dynamic.

Example: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

</body>
</html>
```
